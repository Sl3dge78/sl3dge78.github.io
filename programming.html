	<h2>Transition Altitude</h2>
	<p><img src="programming/TransitionAltitude.png" width="400" alt="Transition Altitude"><br/>
	2020 - Transition Altitude, FFS2020 Game Jam, Unity<br/> 
	It's one of these ideas that sound great in your head: strategic paragliding.<br/>
	Managed to push it through for Finally Finish Something Game Jam. Game has around 10 levels, all by me in Unity.<br/>
	I'm happy with the idea, less with the Level Design that was untested and ends up frustrating.<br/>

	<h2>Pacman</h2>
	<p><img src = "programming/Pacman.png" width="400" alt = "Pacman"><br/>
	2020 - Pacman, C99<br/>
	Just a Pacman clone. Made with SDL. All graphics and audio is by me.<br/>
	First delve into pathfinding and making a finished product.<br/>

	<h2>sl2dge</h2>
	<p><img src = "programming/sl2dge.png" width ="400"><br/>
	2020 - Simple Lightweight 2D Game Engine, C++<br/>
	A very WIP 2D engine, with a map editor and (in the future) an event editor.<br/>
	Uses ECS, has an xml saveformat. Was a lockdown project. I need to revisit it.<br/>

	<h2> Vulkan </h2>
	<p><img src ="programming/vulkan.png" width="400"><br/>
	2020-2021 - Vulkan experimentations, C/C++<br/>
	My first delve into 3D programming. Started as a playground for raytracing in 2020 until I rewrote it completely in C-Style C++ using a classic rasterizer. Delved a bit into pbr at some points.<br/>
	Project on main branch can load a gltf, display it, and has volumetric lighting. Backup of previous states is kept in different branches. Probably the most effort I've put into something.<br/>

	<h2>Password Game </h2>
	<p><img src="programming/password.png" width="400"><br/>
	2021 - Password Game, C-Style C++<br/>
	A bit of a dumb idea I had one day of making a puzzle game about these pesky password requirements. <br/>
	Made in a day. I still like the general idea but lack ideas to make it more interesting. I might update it at some point.<br/>

		<h2>Transition Altitude</h2>
		<p><img src="programming/TransitionAltitude.png" width="400" alt="Transition Altitude"><br/>
		2020 - Transition Altitude, FFS2020 Game Jam, Unity<br/> 
		It's one of these ideas that sound great in your head: strategic paragliding.<br/>
		Managed to push it through for Finally Finish Something Game Jam. Game has around 10 levels, all by me in Unity.<br/>
		I'm happy with the idea, less with the Level Design that was untested and ends up frustrating.<br/>

		<h2>Pacman</h2>
		<p><img src = "programming/Pacman.png" width="400" alt = "Pacman"><br/>
		2020 - Pacman, C99<br/>
		Just a Pacman clone. Made with SDL. All graphics and audio is by me.<br/>
		First delve into pathfinding and making a finished product.<br/>

		<h2> Simple Lightweight 3d Game Engine </h2>
		<p><img src ="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sl3dge78/sl3dge/main/screenshots/3.png" width="400"><br/>
		2020-2021 - Simple Lightweight 3D Game Engine, C/C++<br/>
		My first delve into 3D programming. Started as a playground for raytracing in 2020 until I rewrote it completely in C-Style C++ using a classic rasterizer. Delved a bit into pbr at some points.<br/>
		Project on main branch can load a gltf and PNG textures, display it, has volumetric lighting, can handle vertex skinning and skeletal animations. All of it without libraries (yes I made my own PNG reader for fun). Backup of previous states is kept in different branches. Probably the most effort I've put into something.<br/>

		<h2>Password Game </h2>
		<p><img src="programming/password.png" width="400"><br/>
		2021 - Password Game, C-Style C++<br/>
		A bit of a dumb idea I had one day of making a puzzle game about these pesky password requirements. <br/>
		Made in a day. I still like the general idea but lack ideas to make it more interesting. I might update it at some point.<br/>

		<h2> Gameboy Emulator </h2>
		<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sl3dge78/JaiBoy/main/screenshots/zelda.png" width="400"><br/>
		2021-2022 - Gameboy Emulator - C (later ported in Jai)<br/>
		I love assembly and nitty gritty stuff. So I made an emulator of a console that I grew up with, the Gameboy.<br/>
		Made with SDL. CPU is very accurate. PPU may have innacuracies (need to test on more games). And APU is pretty close, having trouble with the noise channel.<br/> 
		You can still play and enjoy games normally without issues. Features a debugger that can step through instructions and display key memory locations.<br/>

		<h2> Jaida </h2>
		<p><img = src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sl3dge78/jaida/main/screenshots/2.png" width="400"><br/>
		2022 - Jaida - Jai<br/>
		A small 2D Zelda clone in Jai. Made to familiarize myself with the language. The game takes approx 10 mins to complete. <br/>
		It features a mob battles, a single main quest, dialogs, a boss battle and a complete soundtrack composed by me. <br/>
		Made using libraries provided with the language.<br/>
		Art assets are from <a href="https://pixel-boy.itch.io/ninja-adventure-asset-pack">from pixel-boy (cc0)</a><br/>

		<h2> Sl3dge-Jai </h2>
		<p><img src="programming/duckmark.gif" width="400"><br/>
		2022-2023 - Simple Lightweight 3D Game Engine (Jai version)<br/>
		A revisit of my previous engine this time in Jai. Made to support an ongoing project. I used this to project to keep experimenting with 3D rendering and engine architecture.<br/>
		Tried WGPU for a bit but decided to go back to Vulkan in the end. Features include vertex skinning, skeletal animations, immediate mode rendering for UI/2D.<br/>
